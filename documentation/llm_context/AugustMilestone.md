# Milestone Document: Backend Deployment & Client Integration

This document summarizes the key achievements, identified issues, and future direction following the successful deployment of the backend and initial client integration testing.

## 1. Achievements

*   **Complete Client-Server Architecture:**
    *   Successfully transitioned from a client-only application to a full client-server model, fulfilling a critical security requirement from the PRD Addendum.
    *   The backend proxy architecture is now in place, securing the Vertex AI API key and centralizing LLM logic.

*   **Backend Deployment (Phase 2 Complete):**
    *   A robust FastAPI backend has been developed and deployed as a serverless application on **Google Cloud Run**, as outlined in the Backend Roadmap.
    *   The backend is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring a reproducible and scalable environment.
    *   Configuration and secrets are securely managed via Pydantic settings and environment variables, loaded from Google Secret Manager in the deployed environment.

*   **Client-Side UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   The user interface was refactored from a simple dialog into a scalable two-pane dashboard, allowing for the addition of Settings and History pages.
    *   The LLM command flow was re-architected to provide immediate `Generating...` feedback, preventing the UI from freezing during API calls and improving user experience.
    *   A state lock (`is_request_in_flight`) was implemented to prevent concurrent requests from corrupting the application state.

## 2. Bugs and Errors

The following critical bugs were identified during end-to-end testing, as documented in the QA Log and E2E Testing Log. All bugs are located in `src/core/keystroke_listener.py`.

*   **BUG-01: Command Fails with Preceding Text**
    *   **Severity:** Critical
    *   **Description:** The `::command` snippets is only detected if it is at the absolute start of the keystroke buffer. If any other text precedes it, the command fails to trigger.
    *   **Status:** Open

*   **BUG-02: Long Prompts Fail Due to Buffer Trimming**
    *   **Severity:** Critical
    *   **Description:** If a user query within `::Prompt()` exceeds the standard buffer limit (~200 characters), the buffer trimming logic incorrectly cuts off the `::Prompt(` prefix, preventing command detection.
    *   **Status:** Open

*   **Usability Gap: Pasting Text**
    *   **Severity:** Major
    *   **Description:** The keystroke listener's buffer does not reliably handle large blocks of pasted text, making it difficult for users to use existing content in their prompts.
    *   **Status:** Open

## 3. Challenges

*   **Keystroke Detection Logic:** The primary challenge has been the brittleness of the command detection logic in `keystroke_listener.py`. The current implementation, which relies on checking the entire buffer against a list of static snippets *before* checking for the dynamic `::Prompt()` command, is the root cause of the critical bugs.
*   **Untested Cloud Connection:** A significant challenge ahead is the completely untested end-to-end connection between the client and the live, deployed Google Cloud Run service. Potential CORS, authentication, or networking issues are currently unknown, as noted in the July Milestone document.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Priority: Fix Critical Client Bugs**
    *   **Task:** Refactor the `_track_keystrokes` method in `src/core/keystroke_listener.py`. 
    *   **Owner:** You, with my assistance.
    *   **Plan:**
        1.  Modify the logic to check if the buffer **contains** the `::command` pattern, rather than checking if it *starts with* it.
        2.  Change the order of operations: first, check for the static snippet prompt command existing in the buffer, instead of treating the WHOLE buffer
        as just one command and checking it
        E.g.
        buffer = random text ::linkedin 
        Expected: random text [linkedin url as stored]
        Actual: random text ::linkedin <- note no replacement is happening because the ENTIRE buffer is not a valid command and it fails to detect the valid command embedded inside the buffer
    *   **Timeline:** Next development session.


*   **Future Roadmap (Phase 3):**
    *   **Task:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Google Cloud Build to automate testing and deployment.
    *   **Task:** Integrate advanced monitoring, logging, and alerting using the Google Cloud operations suite.
    *   **Task:** Investigate and implement backend caching and rate-limiting to improve performance and control costs.
