## BUG-01: Command fails if buffer has preceding text

- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Open

### Description
The `::Prompt()` command is only detected if it is at the very beginning of the keystroke buffer. If the user types any other text first, the command fails to trigger.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch the application.
2. Type `Hello world`.
3. Then type `::Prompt(test)` and press space.

### Expected Result
The `::Prompt(test)` command should be detected and trigger the API call.

### Actual Result
Nothing happens. The text remains as is.


## BUG-02: Long prompts within ::Prompt still fails to call

- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Open

### Description
If you enter a long prompt inside the ::Prompt(), the buffer will truncate itself, eliminating the "::Prompt()" part form it, thus
the detection for "::Prompt()" fails and no call is made.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch the application.
2. Then type `::Prompt([long paragraph with at least 200 characters]])` and press space.
3. You can observe the log to see when the ::Prompt part has been eliminated from the buffer.

### Expected Result
The `::Prompt(test)` command should have a larger token cap, and throw some kind of warning if the
user's prompt is over that cap, instead of having user to rely on logs. Perhaps even an adjustable one for when we monetize. 

### Actual Result
Nothing happens. The text remains as is.
