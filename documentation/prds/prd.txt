## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose of Feature (Dynamic Augmentation)
*   Enable users to dynamically generate contextually relevant, professionally structured Large Language Model (LLM) prompts.
*   **Trigger:** User types `::Prompt(natural language request)` followed by the `Space` key.
*   **Mechanism:** User's natural language request is sent to an external LLM API for transformation into an enhanced prompt.
*   **Context:** This feature augments an existing system that includes a local prompt library for user-defined, hardcoded command-prompt pairs (managed via UI and stored in JSON). This new feature *does not* use or modify these stored templates.

### 1.2. User Problems Addressed (by this Dynamic Feature)
*   **Novice Users:** Difficulty crafting effective LLM prompts, leading to suboptimal LLM outputs. This feature provides on-the-fly expert prompt structures.
*   **Expert Users:** Time consumed manually typing detailed prompts for novel tasks not covered by their existing hardcoded library. This feature offers rapid generation.

### 1.3. Goals & Objectives
*   **User Empowerment:**
    *   Seamlessly integrate AI-powered prompt generation into the natural typing workflow.
    *   Improve LLM output quality by providing better-structured, dynamically generated prompts.
    *   Reduce manual effort and time for creating novel, detailed prompts.
    *   Lower the barrier to entry for effective ad-hoc LLM utilization.
*   **Product Enhancement:**
    *   Increase user engagement and perceived value of the core tool.
    *   Differentiate the product with intelligent, in-workflow AI assistance.
    *   Provide a foundation for more advanced AI-powered text manipulation.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Ensure total time from `Space` key press to augmented prompt appearance is < 5 seconds (P95).

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas (for this Dynamic Feature)

### 2.1. Primary Users
*   **Knowledge Workers:** Individuals using LLMs for tasks (e.g., drafting, summarizing, ideation, coding).
*   **User Group A (Low Prompt Engineering Skill):** Benefit from AI-guided transformation of simple requests into effective prompts.
*   **User Group B (High Prompt Engineering Skill):** Value efficiency for generating detailed prompts for unique, non-recurring tasks.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** Comfortable with basic computer operations, typing, and inline commands.

### 2.2. User Needs & Pain Points Addressed (by this Dynamic Feature)
*   **Need for Improved Ad-hoc LLM Results:** Desire for accurate, specific outputs from LLMs, even for novel requests.
    *   *Pain Point:* Poorly formulated one-off prompts yield vague LLM responses.
*   **Need for Time Efficiency in Novel Prompting:** Desire to spend less time crafting new, detailed prompts from scratch.
    *   *Pain Point:* Manually typing complex instructions for unique situations is slow.
*   **Need for Seamless Workflow:** Preference for integrated tools over context switching for one-time prompt generation.
    *   *Pain Point:* Switching to external tools to craft a single, unique prompt is disruptive.

## 3. User Stories (for this Dynamic Feature)

*   As a marketing assistant, I want to type `::Prompt(draft a polite follow-up email to a client who missed our last demo)` followed by Space, so the tool generates a well-structured prompt for an LLM to create that specific email.
*   As a software developer, I want to type `::Prompt(explain the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python with examples)` followed by Space, so the tool converts my query into a detailed prompt like:
    ```
    You are a senior Python programming expert. Clearly explain the concepts of shallow copy and deep copy in Python. Provide distinct code examples for each, highlighting their behavior and use cases.
    ```
*   As an office worker, I want the dynamically generated prompt to automatically replace my typed command (`::Prompt(...)`) so I can immediately use or slightly edit it without extra steps.
*   As a user new to advanced LLM prompting, I want to type `::Prompt(generate three creative taglines for a new eco-friendly coffee brand)` followed by Space, so the tool transforms my simple request into a more effective prompt like:
    ```
    As an expert branding strategist, generate three distinct and creative taglines for a new coffee brand that emphasizes its eco-friendly sourcing and premium quality. Each tagline should be concise and memorable.
    ```

## 4. Functional Requirements (for this Dynamic Feature)

### 4.1. Trigger Detection
1.  System shall detect the pattern `::Prompt(` followed by user text and a closing parenthesis `)`.
2.  System shall confirm trigger upon subsequent `Space` key press.

### 4.2. Input Parsing
1.  System shall capture the plain text content (user's natural language request) between `::Prompt(` and `)`.

### 4.3. Prompt Generation (via External LLM API)
1.  System shall take the captured user's natural language request.
2.  System shall construct a standardized request to an external LLM API (e.g., OpenAI). This request will include:
    *   A predefined meta-prompt. Example:
        ```
        You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to transform the following user's natural language request into a highly effective, detailed, and well-structured prompt suitable for a large language model. Ensure the generated prompt elicits a comprehensive and accurate response. User's request: [Captured User Input]
        ```
    *   The captured user input, appended to the meta-prompt.
3.  System shall receive the augmented prompt generated by the external LLM API.

### 4.4. Text Replacement
1.  Upon receiving the augmented prompt, system shall automatically delete the original `::Prompt(user input)` text from the user's current input field.
2.  System shall automatically insert the LLM-generated augmented prompt into the same input field.

### 4.5. Interaction with Existing Prompt Library
1.  This dynamic prompt augmentation feature **does not** use or retrieve templates from the existing local prompt library (JSON file).
2.  For MVP, dynamically generated prompts are **not** automatically stored in the existing local prompt library. Users can manually save them using existing tool mechanisms if desired.

### 4.6. Error Handling
1.  If the external LLM API call fails, system shall retry the call once.
2.  If retry fails, system shall display a concise, non-intrusive inline error message (e.g., `[Prompt Generation Failed. Please try again or check connectivity.]`).
3.  System shall log API call failures (timestamp, error type) for diagnostic purposes, without blocking user workflow.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (for this Dynamic Feature)

### 5.1. Performance
*   Total time from `Space` key press (trigger confirmation) to augmented prompt appearance: < 5 seconds (95th percentile), dependent on external LLM API responsiveness.
*   Text replacement (deletion and insertion) should feel near-instantaneous after API response.

### 5.2. Usability
*   Trigger `::Prompt(...)` + `Space` must be easy to remember and use.
*   Text replacement must be seamless, occurring in the active input field.

### 5.3. Reliability
*   Feature must consistently trigger with correct syntax and `Space` press.
*   Text replacement must accurately delete trigger and insert the new prompt.
*   API call success rate should be maximized by retry logic.

### 5.4. Configuration (MVP)
*   External LLM API key management: Handled by the application using a pre-configured, centralized key. Users do not provide their own keys for MVP.

---

## 6. Assumptions

*   Network connectivity is available for external LLM API calls.
*   Application uses a pre-configured, shared API key for the external LLM (MVP).
*   Users consent to their typed input (within `::Prompt(...)`) being sent to an external LLM API.
*   Tool environment supports keyboard input simulation (backspace, typing).
*   Primary external LLM for development and initial support: OpenAI GPT models.
*   The "Natural Language Processing" for transformation is primarily handled by the external LLM, guided by the standardized meta-prompt.

---

## 7. Dependencies

*   **External LLM API:** Dependency on a third-party LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI), its API availability, and terms.
*   **Python Environment:** Tool is Python-based.
*   **Python Libraries:**
    *   `keyboard` (or similar) for trigger detection and input simulation.
    *   `requests` (or similar) for HTTP calls to LLM API.
*   **Existing Tool Infrastructure:**
    *   Relies on existing mechanisms for text input capture if integrated.
    *   Operates alongside (but independently of) the *existing local storage subsystem and UI for user-defined prompt templates*. This new feature does not directly modify or use that subsystem's data for its dynamic generation logic.

---

## 8. Out of Scope (for this Dynamic Feature - MVP)

*   **Using or managing templates from the existing local prompt library:** This feature is for dynamic generation only. Template retrieval and management are existing, separate functionalities.
*   **Automatic storage of dynamically generated prompts into the local library.**
*   Local LLM model execution or fine-tuning.
*   User-configurable meta-prompts or personas for the dynamic generation process.
*   UI for managing the *logic* of dynamic prompt generation.
*   Support for LLMs other than the designated primary (e.g., OpenAI GPT for MVP).
*   Offline functionality for dynamic prompt generation.
*   Advanced local NLP pre-processing before calling the external LLM API.
*   User-specific API key input or management.
*   Handling of images or other non-text inputs within `::Prompt(...)`.
*   Complex UI elements specific to this dynamic feature.
